                        <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Sam Davis, a web developer working out of Sydney, Australia.</p>
                        <p>
                            I have over 7 years of experience working as a web developer across a wide variety of
                            clients, products and services. I currently specialise in front end development with a focus
                            on making beautiful product come to life. I have extensive experience with various
                            languages, specifically HTML/CSS (Sass/Less), JavaScript/ES6/Flow/Typescript, React, React
                            Native as well as the common front-end tools such as Webpack, Babel, Gulp, NPM, etc. I have
                            backend development experience in NodeJS and PHP/Wordpress. I am very comfortable with a
                            command line and am able to spin up headless server without issue. I love to learn and am
                            always looking to better myself â€“ I work best when building something I care about, both in
                            a team and independently.
